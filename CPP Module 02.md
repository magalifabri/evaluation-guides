# Evaluation Guide: CPP Module 02

Januari 2021

## Introduction
- Only grade the work that is in the student or group's
GiT repository.

- Double-check that the GiT repository belongs to the student
or the group. Ensure that the work is for the relevant project
and also check that "git clone" is used in an empty folder.

- Check carefully that no malicious aliases were used to fool you
and make you evaluate something other than the content of the
official repository.

- To avoid any surprises, carefully check that both the evaluating
and the evaluated students have reviewed the possible scripts used
to facilitate the grading.

- If the evaluating student has not completed that particular
project yet, it is mandatory for this student to read the
entire subject prior to starting the defence.

- Use the flags available on this scale to signal an empty repository,
non-functioning program, a norm error, cheating etc. In these cases,
the grading is over and the final grade is 0 (or -42 in case of
cheating). However, with the exception of cheating, you are
encouraged to continue to discuss your work (even if you have not
finished it) in order to identify any issues that may have caused
this failure and avoid repeating the same mistake in the future.

- Remember that for the duration of the defence, no segfault,
no other unexpected, premature, uncontrolled or unexpected
termination of the program, else the final grade is 0. Use the
appropriate flag.
You should never have to edit any file except the configuration file if it exists.
If you want to edit a file, take the time to explicit the reasons with the
evaluated student and make sure both of you are okay with this.

- You must also verify the absence of memory leaks. Any memory allocated on the heap must
be properly freed before the end of execution.
You are allowed to use any of the different tools available on the computer, such as
leaks, valgrind, or e_fence. In case of memory leaks, tick the appropriate flag.
Disclaimer
Please respect the following rules:

- Remain polite, courteous, respectful and constructive
throughout the evaluation process. The well-being of the community
depends on it.

- Identify with the person (or the group) evaluated the eventual
dysfunctions of the work. Take the time to discuss
and debate the problems you have identified.

- You must consider that there might be some difference in how your
peers might have understood the project's instructions and the
scope of its functionalities. Always keep an open mind and grade
him/her as honestly as possible. The pedagogy is valid only and
only if peer-evaluation is conducted seriously.
Guidelines
You must compile with clang++, with -Wall -Wextra -Werror
As a reminder, this project is in C++98 and C++20 members functions or containers are NOT expected.

Any of these means you must not grade the exercise in question:
- A function is implemented in a header (except in a template)
- A Makefile compiles without flags and/or with something other than clang++

Any of these means that you must flag the project as Forbidden Function:
- Use of a "C" function (*alloc, *printf, free)
- Use of a function not allowed in the subject
- Use of "using namespace" or "friend"
- Use of an external library, or C++20 features
- Use of an already existing container, or any existing function, to implement another container

## Exercise 00: My First Canonical
This exercice introduces the notion of canonical class with a simple arithmetic exemple: the fixed point numbers.

### Accessors
The Fixed class (or whatever its name) must provide accessors to
the raw value:
- int getRawBits( void ) const;
- void setRawBits(
int const raw );
Are these member functions present and functional?

### Canonical
A canonical class must provide at least:
- A default constructor
- A destructor
- A copy constructor
- An assignation operator
Are these elements present and functional?

## Exercise 01: Towards a more useful fixed point class
Ex00 was a good start, but our class is still pretty useless being only able to represent the fixed point value 0.0.

### Floating point constructor
Is it possible to construct an instance from a floating point value?

### << operator
Is there a << operator overload and is it functional?

### Fixed point value to integer value
A member function "int toInt( void ) const;" that converts the
fixed point value to an integer value must be present. Is it functional?

### Fixed point value to floating point value
A member function \"float toFloat( void ) const;\" that converts
the fixed point value to a float value must be present. Is it functional?

### Integer constructor
Is it possible to construct an instance from an integer value?

## Exercise 02: Now weâ€™re talking
This exercice add comparison and arithmetic features to the class.

### Division
The class must provide a division operator. Is it present and functional?

### Addition and substraction
The class must provide addition and substraction operators. Are they present and functional?

### Pre/post increment and pre/post decrement operators
The class must provide the pre-increment, post-increment, pre-decrement
and post-decrement operators, that will increment or decrement the fixed point
value from the smallest representable\\x0F such as 1 + \\x0F > 1. Are they present
and are they functional?

### Multiplication
The class must provide a multiplication operator. Is it present and
functional?

### Min and max
The class must provide 4 non member functions: min, max and their const overloads. Are they present and are they functional?

### Comparison operators
The class must provide 6 comparison operators: \>, <, >=, <=, == and !=.
Are they present and functional?

## Exercise 03: Fixed point expressions
A small fixed point expressions interpreter.

### Small fixed point expressions interpreter
Test the interpreter with more and more complex expressions. Start
with values, then move to simple addtion, multiplications, then test complex
expressions with parenthesis.
Rate it from 0 (failed) through 5 (excellent)
